## Fourth series of exercises

## Exercise 1 :

Make a list with three elements (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Add a **PLAY** button. When **PLAY** is pressed, the computer randomly selects an element (Rock, Paper or Scissors). Compare the element chosen by the player to see who won between the person and the machine.

Bonus: Add a win and defeat counter and display the percentage of the win against the computer.

## Exercise 2:

Use a form to ask for the salary, gender and number of children of a person.

Calculate the salary by deducting the following costs:
- Expenses: 18%;
- Insurance: 7%;
- Contributions: 5%;

It is possible to get discounts on the total costs under certain conditions:
- If the employee is a woman, she will receive a 2% discount.
- If the employee has 3 dependent children, he will receive a 1% discount.
- If the employee has 4 dependent children, he will receive a 2% discount.

## Exercise 3:

Create a form that asks for the name, first name, email address and telephone number of the user.

Check whether the e-mail address is indeed an e-mail address, check whether the telephone number only contains numbers and if the name and first name only contain letters or dashes.

## Exercise 4:

Create a form in which name, first name, date of birth, place of birth, work and company are requested.
Make a "Generate" button to make a short presentation sentence.

Example: If the entered data is:
Lesley Forn, 11/11/1987, Amsterdam, Coach, Genk
then the presentation becomes:
Lesley Forn, Born 11/11/1987 in Amsterdam, currently a Coach in Genk.
