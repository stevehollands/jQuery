## Third series of exercises

**IMPORTANT**.
You must use Jquery to do the exercises.
You can use a [CDN](https://code.jquery.com/) or [download](https://jquery.com/download/) jQuery locally.

## Exercise 1
Build an html page with a button and a text field showing the number of clicks on the button.

## Exercise 2
Build an html page with a "+" button, a "-" button and a text field that shows the number that will be raised or lowered according to the buttons you click.

## Exercise 3
Build an html page with a button and a text field. The goal is to find a number between 0 and 100. For each answer the page answers:
- more
- less
- right

When the answer is found, we are shown the number of tests that we have needed through an alert.

## Exercise 4
Build an html page with 5 buttons and a rectangle. Each button causes an action on the rectangle.
- Button 1: increases the height by 10px, if it is larger than 100px, the height is reset to 10px.
- Button 2: changes the rectangle to green
- Button 3: reset the original colors
- Button 4: Removes the rectangle
- Button 5: the rectangle appears again

## Exercise 5
Build an html page with a square.
When a direction key is pressed (arrow keys), the square 10px moves in the right direction.

BONUS: When the block reaches one side of the page, it must reappear on the other side.
